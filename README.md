# MTG Card Placeholders

This tool will read a deck list and generate a PDF of placeholders to use for the deck.

These can be used a reminders to buy certain cards or as placeholders for a collection if you move them to certain decks.

```python
python3 ./app.py --deck-path <URL or local path to a deck TXT file> [--notes <Any notes to add to the placeholders>]
```
